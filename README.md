# Password Generator

This project aimed to use JavaScript to create a random password generater that would generate a string of random characters based on criteria the user had selected.

Users can choose:

* Password character length must be specified to be between 8 and 128 characters
* Type of characters used such as

- lowercase letters
- uppercase letters
- numeric characters
- special symbol characters

The generator generates a password based on specific selected criteria.
